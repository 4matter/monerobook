## How does Monero work

Monero is based on Cryptonote algorithm and it uses a special blockchain in order to "hide" transactions. A transaction is where a sender transfers the coins to a recipient, both often called Monero users. Monero uses special technologies in order to protect your privacy, you will find a technical explain in the X chapter.

Each transaction has a set of inputs and outputs, where inputs consume coins from sender and outputs transfer them to the recipient. The transaction is digitally signed  by the sender who authorize the transfer. It is then broadcast to the network that groups several transactions in the form of a block and validates it. Once accepted, the block gets appended to a public ledger called blockchain and in the process a new coin is minted.


Almost every cryptocurrency is based on a decentralization system and the using of blockchain in Monero system is important because in this way anyone can't cheat the system. The blockchain also prevents the double spend — i.e., the ability to spend a coin owned more than once.

In order to send, receive and use Monero, you have to use the Monero Blockchain, that is downloaded by Monero Daemon (monerod, section getting started first chapter).
Monero blockchain is growing fast, as you can notice, each month it could grow over 1 gb. For this reason, mobile wallets don't download the entire blockchain, they use a remote node (like node.moneroworld.com:18089) in order to manage the transactions. 



At the moment, Monero is the only cryptocurrency that enables privacy by default.

## Bitcoin as a Private System
Many people may see the randomly-generated addresses and assume that since they are random, Bitcoin is private. They may claim that no one can see who the money belongs to and how it is being used. Unfortunately, this is not the case.

Addresses can be trivially liked together. There will be a permanent record of Leo sending money to George. Suppose Leo's address is hosted on a popular exchange compliant with local law, and suppose George later spends that money on a darknet market. Leo may be questioned about this transfer, since he has an association to how the money is spent in the future.

Similarly, suppose the money George receives from Leo was obtained from the WannaCry ransomware attack. George may be questioned, even if the transfer between these two people is completely legal.

Several companies exist whose entire purpose it is to track the transfer of funds between addresses on transparent blockchains.

## Getting started

### Understanding Monero

If you think Monero as a new food, please read the section What Monero is.

### Container of Moneroj: The wallets

A wallet is a secure and private digital wallet used to store, send and receive Monero cryptocurrency. A Monero wallet uses the Monero Blockchain in order to protect your transactions and the wallet itself.

There are some types of wallets:

*   Cold Wallets

Cold wallets are offline wallets running on desktops environments (Windows, Mac OS and Linux-based systems). With a strong setup (including a firewall, an antivirus), they could be the most secure and private way for storing Monero.

*   Mobile wallets

Mobile wallets are the wallets that running on Android, iOS systems. Actually there are a few wallets built by trusted community users. Those can be the easiest solution for opening a Monero address, however not the most secure!

*   Web wallets

Web wallets are the wallet that are running on third-parties services and you will have the control by a web-based services. As mobile wallets they could be the easiest solution for final users however the worst option for protecting your privacy. Trusted web wallets use a complex cryptography using the client of users in order to protect the wallets. Third services shouldn't have the private key, use those wallets only if you haven't a good platform for wallet!

*   Hardware wallets

Hardware wallets are special wallets which stores the Monero wallet in a secure hardware devices. This way is the best for users that want their Monero wallet in every personal computer. There is an entire section about it: go to 10th chapter for more information.

TIP:

The best choice is running Monero on linux based systems: Windows and Mac OS X aren't open sourced so no one can guarantee you they haven't any backdoors. As a developer, you should use the shell in order to understand correctly and fully Monero.

### Monero Tools for Windows, Mac and Linux system

*   Monero Daemon called `monerod` : it manage the Monero blockchain

*   Monero Wallet Graphical User Interface called `monero-wallet-gui`: a simple GUI client for managing Monero wallets

*   Monero Wallet Command Line Interface

*   Monero Wallet Remote Procedural Call (called monero-wallet-rpc): a helpful software that creates a API in order to link to Monero wallets. A lot of web services are based on Monero Wallet RPC

### How to use Monero GUI (Graphical User Interface)

1.  Open Monero daemon (called monerod);
2.  Wait for blocks synchronization (it can take 1-2 days);
3.  Open Monero Wallet GUI (called monero-wallet-gui);
4.  Select the language;
5.  Option "Create a wallet";
6.  Enter the name of wallet: you can enter anything for the name of the wallet. This name will not be shared with anyone else, so entering your real name will not be a privacy leak.  Monero Wallet GUI will print to screen a SEED, that's is important in case of restoring a wallet, so you shouldn't share the seed with others;
7.  Type the password; Same as name of wallet, you can enter anything;
8.  Yay! You have a Monero public address!

### How to use Monero Wallet CLI (Command Line Interface)

The command line for Monero could be the best option to manage in a fast way your monero as an expert user.

1.  Open Monero daemon (called monerod);
2.  Wait for blocks synchronization (it can take 1-2 days);
3.  Open Monero wallet cli (called monero-wallet-cli, see available flag for more informations );
4.  You will have two option: creating a wallet or opening a wallet. Just text the wallet name, if monero-wallet-cli find your wallet, it will try to open it else it will try to create a new one with the name texted;
5.  Text the password and the language
6.  Yay! You have a Monero public address!

### How to Get Monero

*   BUYING

The easiest way for getting Monero is purchasing them from final users. Helpful websites like [localmonero.co](https://localmonero.co/) might help you. Some users might not provide you Moneroj after payment with payment processor  (paypal, bills, stripe..), these users are called scammer, avoid them.

*   EXCHANGE

Cryptocurrency exchanges are online platforms where you can exchange one cryptocurrency for another cryptocurrency (or for fiat currency). In other words, depending on the exchange, it is either like a stock exchange or a currency exchange (at the airport or bank) This is probably the most used way: simply, if you have another cryptocoin like Bitcoin, you can get Monero by exchange. They are basically online wallets, so take some consideration when you are using those.

*   MINING

Monero is a proof of work (as know as PoW) cryptocurrency that can be miner with computational power from a CPU or GPU. There are currently no ASICs for Monero, which means that anyone with a computer can mine it. The first thing you need to think about is if you are going to mine solo or on a pool. Mining on a pool usually comes with a fee however also has it's advantages. Users that don't have enough computational power may have to wait long periods of time before getting a reward, in a pool users pull their efforts together in order to reduce variance and have a steady flow of income. Users that have enough hardware or simply want to mine solo can also benefit from solo pools which function in the same way as normal solo mining, however don't require users to run a full node or store the entire blockchain.
